### Welcome to GitHub Pages.
Based on the J.A.R.V.I.S. machine portrayed in the Iron Man films, this personal assistant (name tbd) is based of Python and runs on a Raspberry Pi.

### Tools and APIs
Current functionality is limited due to missing hardware. Voice recognition for the initial keyword commands is implemented using PocketSphinx, while further calls to external APIs and general queries are sent to the WIT.AI API, and translated to text through there. The voice module is planned to be based off the Festival TTS Synthesizer.  

### Planned Functionality
After implementing the simple commands like music, reminders and news, the plan is to implement machine learning algorithms to  the software to "learn" the habits and schedules of the user. For example, having saved data on a user's sleep and work schedule, the personal assistant can play certain music when the user needs to focus or when the user is not feeling well. The device will eventually evolve into a smart, learning machine that fits to the user's needs.
